 * \section intro Introduction
 * This example demonstrates how to use the common IOPORT service for pin
 * control.
 *
 * \section files Main Files
 *  - ioport.h common gpio definitions
 *  - ioport_example2.c example application
 *  - conf_example.h example definitions
 *
 * \section ioport_service_section services/ioport/ioport.h
 * The common IOPORT service is described in
 * \ref ioport_group section.
 *
 * \section device_info Device Info
 * All Atmel SAM, MEGA, XMEGA and UC3 devices can be used. This example has been
 * tested with the following setup:
 *  - Xplain evaluation kit
 *  - EVK1100 evaluation kit
 *  - SAM3X evaluation kit
 *  - SAM4L evaluation kit
 *  - SAM4L Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAM4L8 Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAM4E evaluation kit
 *  - SAM4N Xplained Pro kit
 *  - STK600 evaluation Kit (Tested with STK600-ATMEGA128RFA1)
 *  - ATmega256RFR2 Xplained Pro kit 
 *  - SAM4C evaluation kit
 *  - SAMG53 Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAMG55 Xplained Pro kit
 *  - SAMV71 Xplained Ultra kit
 *  - SAME70 Xplained Pro kit
 *
 * \section example_description Description of the example
 * This example flashes a single LEDs present with flash speed of 1Hz.
 *
 * Additionally a pin input can inspected from a debug session.
 *
 * \section compinfo Compilation Info
 * This software was written for the GNU GCC and IAR for SAM and AVR.
 * Other compilers may or may not work.
